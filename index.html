                <h2 class="question" id="wheretitle">Where is Trinity Inlet?</h2>
                <p class="info" id="whereparagraph">The trinity inlet is among one of the more than 1,500 estuaries in Australia. The trinity inlet goes by many names inlcuding carins estuary, chinamans creek and carins harbour. It is located right in the city of Carins, Queensland(16°55'S.,145 "47'E.). The estuary is quite shallow about 10m - 13m deep. Starting from a wide but shallow bay, Trinity streches about 10km inland to form the Mulgrave river.
            
                    Its water are a sanctuary for marine life, having its creeks fringed by mangroves and mudbanks. Within the water are extensive mudflats, seagrass beds, sand bars with small rocky areas exposed at low tide.</p>

<div id="questiontwo">
    <h2 class="question" id="whattypetitle">What type of estuary?</h2>
    <p class="info" id="estuarytypeparagraph">In Australia and across the globe there are 4 ways estuarys are formed. All of these types can be esily identify by their charcteristics. The first is a sandbar estuary which can be idetifyed as having a distinct sand bar forming a lagoon. The second is a Fjord, these estuaries are formed within U-shaped valleys that once held glaciers however Australia was never effected by the ice age so we know Trinity is not a Fjord. Thirdly, a tectonic estuary which is formed by convergent tectonic activity, and we know that the east coast of Queensland recives very minimal tectonic activy as it is not on the ring of fire. This leaves the Trinity to fit the fourth type of estuary a drowned river valley. 

       <br><br> Most drowed river vallies were created from the melting of the last ice age, where the sealevels rose immensely, aprox 120m meaning that along many coasts the seawater inundated nearby low-lying land like valleys.   We can identiy the trinity as a drowed river valley becuase of its apperance. We can see  that the Trinity is because of the way the water flows through, as it is consistently splitting off into smaller river & creeks. These creeks represent evidence of how the ocean water has flooded the valleys between the mountains. Another reason is its larrge delta.Where the Trinity inlet lies now used to be known as the valley of the Mulgrave when sea levels were much lower.</p>

        <h2 class="question">WHO COMES TO TRINITY INLET AS PART OF THIER LIFE CYCLE?</h2>
        <p class="info" id="dogongparagraph" >The Dogong is a species of marine mammal that are found abundantly in the Carins Estuary. They are a source of attraction to tourists and are known for bieng the ‘cows of the sea’. This is becuase they spend thier days feeding on seagrass and can eat up to 40kg/day.Seagrass is a type of flowering aquatic plant with a true root system that holds the plant in the sand/mud. The lush seagrass beds of the trinity inlet is what makes it so appealing to the dogongs. </p>

            <source src="Marine/dugong3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
        <p class="info">Dogongs are a very intresting type of animal and they rely on the Trinity inlet for their life cycle. In order for a female dogong to have a baby she needs to have enough food. When a baby dogong is born they must suckle thier mother for the first 18 months, meaning the mother will have to conume enough energy for her and her baby. When a female dogong reaches 4 she can reproduce and be pregnant for 13 to 15 months. Dugongs have calves every 2 to 5 years depending on how much food they have to eat. However after aroung age 17 a female can no longer get pregnant even though the average dogong lives to 70 years old!</p>
        
        <p class="info">Dogongs aren’t the only species that rely on the seagrass. Seagrass create diverse habitats for many different species of marine life, including fish, crabs, shellfish, seahorses,sea stars, sea cucumbers, sea turtles and dugongs who rely on it for food & shelter. Unfortunaltly urban runoff is dumping excessive amounts of nutrients into the water and this overwhelms many species of marine plants including sea grass. With the disappearance of seagrass comes with it the dugongs and countless other marine animals. Even we rely on the seagrass for our future as with human activity and climate change our oceans are becoming more acidic. But ocean plants like seagrass pull Co2 from the air and turn it into valuable oxegen.</p>

    <h2 class="question">WHO EATS WHOM IN THE TRINITY INLET?</h2>
<img src="Marine/Producers.png" alt="Producers" width="75%">
<h2 class="question">Trinity food chain summary</h2>
<p class="info">Planktivorous species make up the most abundant group in the trinity inlet meaning that our primary consumers make up majority of life in the cairns estuary (1).
    The food web represents relationships between the communityThe phytoplankton is a producer. It is consumed by the zooplankton and other microorganisms like nematodes and rotifers, which are eaten by meiofauna which aresmall benthic invertebrates that live in marine or freshwater environments. Meiofauna are eaten by small juvenile fish, shrimps and crustaceans. These fish are eaten by bigger fish like Mugil Cephalus, Sciaenidae and Tachysuridae etc. These bigger fish are preyed upon by apex predators like sharks, dolphins and even larger fish species like barracuda.
    The relationships between these animals are fragile, they all rely on one another, for example the seagrass are responsible for protecting and providing shelter for the smaller/juvenile fish from the larger fish. Even dolphins and sharks play their role, as they keep the fish population in check. Waste from microorganisms (detritus) are also a main food source for 100s of marine species like the common mullet.</p>

<div id="questionfive">
    <h2 class="question">HOW WE USE THE Estuary</h2>
    <p class="info">Estuarys are not just important for the live of fish, but humans benifit from them too. We tend to establish many towns and cities around them as they give our boats easy access to the ocean. Even the Trinity inlet is now almost surrounded by the city of Carins. Carins is such a popular tourist destenation by international and domestic tourists. Many people make use of the estuary with recreational fishing, snorkelling swimming and more. There are also commercial uses for the Trinity inlet such as Carins Crusing Yacht Squadrun a boating club. This club charges 20$/week subscription to be part of the club and have access to the bar and bistro located upon the estuaries waterfront. Fishing is so popualar in Carins Harbour and estuary that many tourists even pay for half or full day fishing tours and for those you don’t like fishing there is boat hire.</p>

<div id ='questionsix'>
 <h2 class="question">WHY PROTECT THE ESTUARY FROM OUR CHANGEING WORLD?</h2>
 <p class="info">In the 1970s the trinity inlets was turned into a sugarcane farm by CSR, a 7km wall pierced through the mangrove forests, river and mudflats and stopped the flow of water. 3,000 tonnes of sulfuric acid leaked from the soil every year and thus dumped into the estuary poisoning it and giving it the same pH level as battery acid (2.5). Since then the Queensland government as removed this barrier that has prevented the tide from coming in and re-introduced the sea water into the Trinity inlet. We need to protect the estuary because it is a home for so much wildlife and many animals use it to have their young 70% of species in the estuary are most abundant as juveniles.</p>
 <p class="info">This is not just about protecting the estuary but Queenslands tourism industry, no natural beauty, no tourism right now the tourism industry of queensland is huge $22 billion you think Australia would be able to afford this loss? The estuary and the ocean are connected and go hand in hand the water in the Trinity inlet is the same water as in the great barrier reef, if the Trinity inlet is unhealthy it poses a great threat to the reef not only is the reef a gorgeous marvel of nature but is half the reason that tourists are attracted to Queensland. When the estuary became acidic this water flowed to the reef and resulted in a massive loss of coral, a loss of potenial income for the tourism industry.</p>
